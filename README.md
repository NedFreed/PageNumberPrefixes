# PageNumberPrefixes

This is a revision to a customization layer for the DocBook XSL Stylesheets to support page number prefixes. The original
version is located at http://wiki.docbook.org/PageNumberPrefixes. This version has been modified to work with the 1.78.1
version of the Docbook XSL Stylesheets. The previous version was based on the 1.60.1 version.
